# DanceCrazeVR
VR dance game prototype using Unity 6 and Meta SDK for XR Bootcamp.
## Idea

A VR dance game focused on learning, fun, and being attractive through dance. Players select viral dance moves and perform them like a professional dancer using full-body tracking. The goal is to enjoy dancing, improve movement accuracy, and feel confident and expressive. This prototype proves that social media-inspired dance challenges can become immersive XR experiences that combine skill-building and self-expression.

## Features

**Core features:** 

These are the features that your prototype ***really*** needs to function or to prove your point.

- Full-body pose detection with Meta Quest 3 (head, hands, torso)
- Real-time avatar mirrors the player’s dance
- Selection of viral dance moves
- Scoring system based on accuracy and rhythm

**Stretch goals:** 
- Camera + AI-assisted predicted tracking for full-body estimation without hardware trackers
- Avatar customization (gender, outfit, body type)
- Stage selection (visual dance environments)
- Custom choreography creator: players design original dances that can go viral
- Multiplayer dance challenges
- Social media sharing: record and share your performance
- Flexible music system: perform any dance move to any song, including trending tracks

## Key Learning Points
I learned how to set up Meta’s Body Pose Detection SDK and create a custom XR scene with full-body tracking. I tested avatar mirroring and synced movements with a dance partner, which proved that social-media style dance gameplay works well in VR and feels fun and expressive. I considered using Final IK for AI-based prediction, but focused on core gameplay instead.
**My main goa**l is to continue developing this game at a professional level using external full-body tracking hardware. This will make the experience far more accurate, expressive, and immersive, especially for dancers and content creators. I aim to turn this project into a polished product that can be released and sold commercially.
